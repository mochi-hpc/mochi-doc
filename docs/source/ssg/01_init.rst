Initializing SSG
================

The following code sample shows how to initialize and finalize
SSG. Though SSG uses Margo for communications, it does not rely
on it at initialization time.

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header
    
       .. container:: btn btn-info

          main.c (show/hide)

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../code/ssg/01_init/main.c
       :language: cpp
