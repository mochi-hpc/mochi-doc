Creating a group from a file
============================

Should the list of member addresses be available in a text file
(one address per line), the following code sample shows how to
create a group from this file.

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header

       .. container:: btn btn-info

          main.c (show/hide)

    .. literalinclude:: ../../../code/ssg/03_create_file/main.c
       :language: cpp
