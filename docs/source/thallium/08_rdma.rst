.. _ThalliumBulk:

Transferring data over RDMA
===========================

In this tutorial, we will learn how to transfer data over RDMA.
The class at the core of this tutorial is :code:`thallium::bulk`.
This object represents a series of segments of memory within the
current process or in a remote process, that is exposed for remote
memory accesses.

Client
------

Here is an example of a client sending a "do_rdma" RPC with a bulk object as argument.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../code/thallium/08_rdma/client.cpp
       :language: cpp

In this client, we define a buffer with the content "Matthieu"
(because it's a string, there is actually a null-terminating character).
We then define segments as a vector of pairs of :code:`void*` and :code:`std::size_t`.
Each segment (here only one) is characterized by its starting address in local
memory and its size. We call :code:`engine::expose` to expose the buffer and
get a :code:`bulk` instance from it. We specify :code:`tl::bulk_mode::read_only`
to indicate that the memory will only be read by other processes
(alternatives are :code:`tl::bulk_mode::read_write` and :code:`tl::bulk_mode::write_only`).
Finally we send an RPC to the server, passing the bulk object as an argument.

Server
------

Here is the server code now:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../code/thallium/08_rdma/server.cpp
       :language: cpp

In the RPC handler, we get the client's :code:`endpoint` using
:code:`req.get_endpoint()`. We then create a buffer of size 6.
We initialize :code:`segments` and expose the buffer to get a :code:`bulk`
object from it. The call to the :code:`>>` operator pulls data from
the remote :code:`bulk` object :code:`b` and the local :code:`bulk` object.
Since the local :code:`bulk` is smaller (6 bytes) than the remote one (9 bytes),
only 6 bytes are pulled. Hence the loop will print *Matthi*.
It is worth noting that an :code:`endpoint` is needed for Thallium to know
in which process to find the memory we are pulling. That's what :code:`bulk::on(endpoint)`
does.

Understanding local and remote bulk objects
-------------------------------------------

A :code:`bulk` object created using :code:`engine::expose` is local.
When such a :code:`bulk` object is sent to another process, it becomes remote.
Operations can only be done between a local :code:`bulk` object and a remote :code:`bulk`
object resolved with an endpoint, e.g.,

.. code-block:: cpp

   myRemoteBulk.on(myRemoteProcess) >> myLocalBulk;

or

.. code-block:: cpp

   myLocalBulk >> myRemoteBulk.on(myRemoteProcess);

The :code:`<<` operator is, of course, also available.

Transferring subsections of bulk objects
----------------------------------------

It is possible to select part of a bulk object to be transferred.
This is done as follows, for example.

.. code-block:: cpp

   myRemoteBulk(3,45).on(myRemoteProcess) >> myLocalBulk(13,45);

Here we are pulling 45 bytes of data from the remote :code:`bulk`
starting at offset 3 into the local :code:`bulk` starting at its
offset 13. We have specified 45 as the number of bytes to be
transferred. If the sizes had been different, the smallest
one would have been picked.
