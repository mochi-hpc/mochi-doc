Thallium
========

This section will walk you through a series of tutorials on how to use
Thallium. We highly recommend to read at least up to the tutorial
on providers, which will give you a good picture of how to make a truely
object-oriented Mochi service with Thallium.

Thallium also provide a complete object-oriented wrapper for Argobots.
One important thing to keep in mind is that these wrappers should be used
in place of the C++ threading library.

.. important::
   One of the most frequent source
   of bug we encounter is developers mistakenly using :code:`std::mutex`
   or :code:`std::thread` intead of their Thallium counterparts
   :code:`thallium::mutex` and :code:`thallium::thread`.
