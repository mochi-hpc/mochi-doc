Configuring Bedrock using Jx9
=============================

JSON configurations for Bedrock can very quickly become complicated
to write by hand, especially when trying to list many execution
streams for use in a many-core node, associated with as many pools
and providers. This is where Jx9 can help again.

By using the :code:`--jx9` argument of the :code:`bedrock` program,
one can use a Jx9 program instead of a JSON file to generate the
configuration.

The code bellow is an example of such a Jx9-based configuration.
It first initializes a base configuration, then uses a loop to
add as many pools as requested in the :code:`argobots` section.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../code/bedrock/06_jx9/example.jx9
   :language: json

Bedrock can use this file as follows.

.. code-block:: console

   bedrock ofi+tcp --jx9 -c example.jx9 --jx9-context num_extra_pools=4

The :code:`--jx9-context` argument allows setting variables before
the Jx9 script is executed, in the form of coma-separated assignments
(e.g. :code:`x=1,y=2.5,z="abc"` ).
