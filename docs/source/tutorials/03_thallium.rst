Thallium exercises
==================

This section contains three exercises meant to accompany Mochi tutorials.
These tutorials focus on using the C++ language, with the Thallium library.
They revolve around the development of a phonebook microservice,
i.e. a service that associates names (:code:`std::string`s) with
phone numbers (which will be represented as :code:`uint64_t` values).

The three exercises are relatively independent of each other,
though we recommend completing each of them to get a good understanding
of Thallium and Mochi in general.
