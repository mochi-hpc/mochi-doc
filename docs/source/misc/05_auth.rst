Using Mochi for multi-user services
===================================

Multi-user services generally require authentication/authorization.
Such a system is generally bespoke to each service, hence we have not
attempted to provide a generic component to handle this aspect.

However, `in this repository <https://github.com/mochi-hpc/mochi-auth-examples>`_
you will find a tutorial on how to use `MUNGE <https://dun.github.io/munge/>`_
in combination with Mochi to implement such a mechanism.
